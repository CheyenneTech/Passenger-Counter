Below I will be keeping JS notes that do not pertain directly to the js I am writing. 

MORE ON innerText: The innerText property can be used to write the dynamic text on the html document. Here, text will not be interpreted as html text but a normal text. It is used mostly in the web pages to generate the dynamic content such as writing the validation message, password strength etc.

The DOM, stands for Document Object Model. This is just how you use JS to modify a website.

Breaking down DOM ...
Document: because the type of doc you are interacting with is an html doc. 
Object: because the doc keyword in JS is of the data type object. Meaning they have taken the html doc and shoved it into a js doc
Model:  a representation of your element from html to js



when it comes to strings and numbers the string will always come first

example of this
console.log(4 +5) // 9
console.log('2' + '4') // '24'
console.log('5' + 1) // '51'
console.log(100 + '100') // '100100'
